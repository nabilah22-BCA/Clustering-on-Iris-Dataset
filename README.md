# Clustering-on-Iris-Dataset
This repository contains an implementation of clustering techniques applied to the Iris dataset from the sklearn library. The project explores how unsupervised learning methods can group data points based on inherent patterns.
Features

#Dataset: Iris dataset from sklearn.

#Algorithms: KMeans Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering.

#Visualizations: PCA-reduced feature visualizations and dendrograms.

#Files

clustering.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete implementation and analysis.

#How to Use

#Clone the repository.

#Install required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.

#Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells step by step.
